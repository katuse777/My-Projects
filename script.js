/*This function should randomly RETURN rock, paper or scissors 
  To make this random, I'll uss the Math.random function to generate 
   a number btween 0 and 3 and I'll assign each choice a value between 0 and 3
   and I'll use if statements to decide wht to return*/


/*This the pseudocode for the computerPlay function

  function computerPlay() {
      generate a random number between 0 and 3, which will be 0,1 and 2
      when I use the Math.random()*3 and I round the number to a whole number
      I SHOULD MAKE A SEPERATE FUNCTION THAT GENERATE THE RANDOM NUMBER AND 
      ROUNDS IT'S AND THEN CALL IT IN MY computerPlay function

      now i should assign the function a return value depending on the the number that was returned

      if(number is 0) return Rock
      if(number is 1) return Paper
      else return scissor
